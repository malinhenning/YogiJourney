          This is a website for all Yogis out there who wants to create a space
          for yoga, meditation, journaling and maybe connect with other
          like-minded people. There is always time for reflection, slowing down
          and connect with yourself, in your own way. In here, you can find
          tools to help you do just that, but also inspiration, yoga flows,
          journaling prompts and much more.

        <p>PS. Currently under construction.</p>
